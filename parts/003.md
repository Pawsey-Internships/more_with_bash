## 3. Syntax of a Unix Command

**Command-line utilities** on **Unix-like** operating systems follow the syntax:

> *verb* *adverb(s)* *object(s)*

Or, equivalently:

> [COMMAND] [OPTION(s)] [FILES(s)]

For example:

	ls -A ~/

Where `ls` (list files) is the verb, `-A` (list everything but `.` and `..`) is the adverb and `~/` (the user home directory) is the object. 

**Command line utilities** (or just commands) are a small programs designed for use in a command-line **shell**. When executed, they read input data from the **stdin** (standard in) **data stream** and returns an output the **stdout** (standard output) **data stream**. This predictable behaviour allows for the output of one command to be **piped** to the input of another.
