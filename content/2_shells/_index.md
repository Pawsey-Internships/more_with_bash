## 2. Shells

A shell is a program that provides a user interface to the services of an operating system. Beneath the shell is the operating system kernel - which acts as a bridge of the between the software installed on the computer and its hardware.

Shells can be graphical (e.g. the Windows desktop environment) or command-line based. Command-line shells offer the advantages of low system overhead, integration with **shell scripting languages** and reproducibility. For this reason, many graphical programs are built on, or offer a collection of equivalent, command-line utilities.

The most common shell is the Borne Again Shell (BASH) - it is the default for most Linux distributions. Another common shell is the Z shell (zsh) - which extends the features of BASH. It is the default shell on current versions of macOS.
