BASH is a scripting language. Scripting languages are programming languages that manipulate or automate exisitng systems. For BASH this is the Unix file system, the input and output of command line utilities and  **environment variables** that  control the behaviours of software.

Python is a high-level programming language that can be used as a scripting language. However, for operation on files, BASH is often faster and requires fewer lines of code. For more complex tasks, Python is a better choice as it is more flexible and easier to maintain.

As a rule-of-thumb, BASH is a good choice for 'set and forget' scripts with fewer than 100 lines.
